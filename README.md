
# Dodgers Injury Risk Prediction Project

This project is a machine learning pipeline designed to predict MLB player injury risks, specifically focusing on the Dodgers but extensible to any MLB team.

## Components

###  Data Sources
- `mlb_player_info.py`: Retrieves player metadata.
- `mlb_player_stats.py`: Scrapes game log statistics.
- `injury_stats.py`: Scrapes injury records from the MLB API and updates the local database (`injury_stats` table) without overwriting prior data.

###  Database
- SQLite database (`mlb_players.db`) stores:
    - Player information
    - Player game logs
    - Injury history (with columns for player, date, season, team, and injury description)

###  Data Preprocessing
- Calculates 5-game and 10-game rolling averages for player workload and performance metrics.
- Merges game logs with injury data to label records as injured or not.
- Ensures consistent feature preparation across teams (e.g., Dodgers, Phillies).

###  Model
- The XGBoost classifier was trained on resampled (SMOTE-balanced) data.
- Predicts the probability of injury (scaled to % for readability).
- Outputs a ranked list of players most at risk.

###  Usage
- Filter by team and season (example: Dodgers, 2025).
- Generate ranked injury risk predictions with player names and readable risk percentages.
- Extendable: swap team names to analyze other MLB teams.

###  Safety & Updates
- `injury_stats.py` updates the injury database by **inserting or ignoring duplicates**, ensuring past data is preserved.
- Requirements can be exported using:
    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

###  Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- xgboost
- imbalanced-learn
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sqlite3
- requests

### How to Run
1. Run data scraping scripts to populate the database.
2. Train the model using `Model Training.ipynb`.
3. Use `Risk Predictor.ipynb` or Python scripts to generate injury predictions.

### 🏆 Outputs
- Top-ranked player injury risk tables per team.
- CSV exports of injury risk predictions for further analysis.
